This is the latest installment of the example application for the Data Template Pattern. This is the truest form of the pattern. A set of callables and input/output that are available to each other in a chain of data/template calls. To see the meat of the application check out the file: /src/vendor/builder/src/dta.php

This project is completely open source with the hopes that people will use and develop and re-published it on their own.

For the the original Data Template Pattern example, head on over to the branch labeled "one".

For a simple intro to building your own webpage head on over to the branch labeled "Simple1".
